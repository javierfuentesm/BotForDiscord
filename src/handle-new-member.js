Hello ${user} ðŸ‘‹
I'm a bot and I'm here to welcome you to the KCD Community on Discord! Before you can join in the fun, I need to ask you a few questions. If you have any trouble, please email team@kentcdodds.com with your discord username (\`${username}#${discriminator}\`), an explanation of the trouble, and a screenshot of the conversation. And we'll get things fixed up for you.
(Note, if you make a mistake, you can edit your responses).
In less than 5 minutes, you'll have full access to this server. So, let's get started! Here's the first question:
    `.trim()
  );

  await send(getSteps(member)[0].question);
}
const getSend = (channel) => async (...args) => {
  if (!args[0]) {
    throw new Error("Attempting to call send with no message!");
  }
  const result = await channel.send(...args);
  // wait a brief moment before continuing because channel.send doesn't
  // always resolve after the message is actually sent.
  await sleep(200);
  return result;
};
